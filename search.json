There are 43 lectures during the semester (excluding examinations). You will receive one point for attendance at each lecture up to 40 points (i.e., you will not receive extra credit for attending all 43 lectures). Thus, you will not be penalized for missing up to 3 lectures. However, you will be responsible for learning any material missed for quizzes and exams, and I strongly encourage you to attend all lectures. Poor lecture attendance is likely to affect the quality of students’ work and success in the course.\nStudents who miss more than 3 lectures due to participation in University activities must give the instructor a statement before the absence signed by a responsible official that specifies the dates and times the student will miss class. Authorized activities include participation in athletic teams, the marching band or pep band, debate teams, and other recognized University groups, as well as participation in University field trips, service with the National Guard, and jury duty. Absences due to illnesses or emergencies (that go over 3 lectures) must be documented with the University of Iowa Absence Explanation Form and sent to the TA within 48 hours of the absence. Per university policy, if a student will be absent 5 or more consecutive days and the absence is due to illness or other emergency, please contact the Registrar Service Center at (319) 384-4300 or registrar@uiowa.edu."

Quizzes will consist of approximately 20–30 multiple choice or very short answer questions. Although students may take the quiz at any time when it is available, students must complete the quiz within 2 hours. We will not accept late responses or multiple submissions. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped. We will not accept excused absences for quizzes because (a) you have a week to complete the quiz (and can submit it at any point during that week), and (b) we drop your lowest quiz score.

The topic of the paper is completely up to the student; the only requirement is that it must be relevant to psychopathology in children or adolescents. The paper must include a review and analysis of at least 5 empirical articles on the topic, published since 2000. You are encouraged to work with the UI Writing Center in revising your paper.\n\n14.8.1 Format\nThe paper should have five sections:\n\nCover Letter, described here\nTitle Page\nAbstract\nMain body\nReferences\n\nThe main body of the paper should be 10–12 pages, excluding the cover letter, title page, abstract, and references. The text should be double-spaced, in APA format, and in 12-point Times New Roman font. For sample papers in APA format, see here.\n\n\n14.8.2 Stages\n\n14.8.2.1 Overview\nThis paper will be completed in 6 stages, all uploaded to ICON:\n\nGenerate a topic\nIdentify articles\nUnderstand findings from articles\nWrite a complete draft\nGive and receive feedback\nIncorporate feedback and polish writing\n\nThe goals of this project are for each student to produce a thoughtful paper that describes an aspect of this course that captured their interest and to gain more experience with scientific writing. Each stage of the process will be discussed in class, so attendance is critical. Additionally, grading rubrics for each stage will be posted so that students understand the basis for evaluation of each stage of the assignment. Successful completion of this assignment requires students to adhere closely to the deadlines outlined. For this reason, substantial penalties will be applied to all late work (20% off final grade for each day the assignment is late). Further, to make sure the peer review process for first drafts is successful, any first drafts submitted after the deadline of Friday, November 3 will receive a zero and will not receive a peer review (the student will still receive instructor feedback). If you have concerns about meeting one of the literature review deadlines, please contact Professor Petesen or the TA as soon as possible to discuss. All assignments should be uploaded to ICON by 11:59 p.m. on the due date.\nThe stages—and deadlines—are described below:\n\n\n14.8.2.2 Deadlines\nThe workflow of the literature review stages, their respective percentages in the total literature review grade, and relevant due dates are listed below.\n\n\n\nStage\nAssignment Description\nPercent\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\n1\nDevelop a topic description (2 sentences) and 3–5 keywords you will then use to conduct a literature search using Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and/or PubMed.\n2.5%\n9/15\n\n\n2\nIdentify and generate a list of 5 empirical articles that you will include in your review based on your searches of Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and/or PubMed.\n2.5%\n9/25\n\n\n3\nWrite brief summaries of each of the 5 empirical articles that includes clear descriptions of both the methodology and relevant findings.\n10%\n10/16\n\n\n4\nCompose a complete first draft of the review that includes an introduction with thesis, description, critique, and integration of the 5 empirical studies.\n25%\n11/3\n\n\n5a\nPeer reviews are assigned.\n–\n11/6\n\n\n5b\nGive feedback by providing anonymous peer review of another student’s paper.\n10%\n11/27\n\n\n5c\nReceive feedback from peer and from instructor.\n–\n11/29\n\n\n6\nIncorporate feedback and produce a final document.\n50%\n12/8\n\n\n\n\n\n14.8.2.3 Stage 1: Generate a Topic\nYou will first develop a topic and a set of keywords for your paper. For the review format, this involves generating a specific topic and keywords you will then use to conduct a literature search using Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and/or PubMed. We will discuss strategies for generating topics and keywords in class, and examples will be provided. By the deadline, you will turn in a summary of your research topic (1–2 sentences) and a list of keywords that will start your literature search.\n\n\n14.8.2.4 Stage 2: Identify Articles\nAfter your topic has been approved, you will then conduct a search to identify the articles for your paper. You will search PsychINFO or PubMed and identify a minimum of five empirical articles that are all relevant to your topic. As we will discuss in class, it is important to define your topic carefully so that all of your identified articles are addressing common components. By the deadline, you will turn in your list of articles.\n\n\n14.8.2.5 Stage 3: Understand Findings from Articles\nOnce you have identified the five papers you wish to write about, you will then produce brief summaries of each article that include a description of the methods employed by the researchers and their basic findings (2–4 paragraphs per article for each of your five articles). You will also include your reference list, in APA style. By the deadline, you will turn in your article summaries.\n\n\n14.8.2.6 Stage 4: Write a Complete Draft\nNext, you will write and turn in a complete draft of your paper. The systematic review should include both description of the empirical studies you’ve included as well as analysis, critique, and integration of findings. For this stage, you will also generate a thesis that describes the overall message of your review and you will work to demonstrate how each article is (or is not) supportive of your thesis. The goal of this stage is to develop your ideas and argument so that you can receive feedback. By the deadline, you will turn in your first draft of the paper. Note: you must turn in a complete draft of your paper—not an outline.\n\n\n14.8.2.7 Stage 5: Give and Receiving Feedback\nFollowing submission of your first draft, all students will receive detailed feedback from the instructor, which will include critique of content, organization, and argument. Additionally each student will complete an anonymous peer review of a fellow student’s paper (your draft will also be peer reviewed). Peer reviews will be blinded and only I (the instructor) will know which papers belong to which students. Reviews will be assigned in class. More details about providing an appropriate review and the formatting will be provided in class. By the deadline, you will turn in your review of the peer’s paper. The instructor will then re-distribute the peer reviews to authors.\n\n\n14.8.2.8 Stage 6: Incorporating Feedback and Polishing Writing\nYou will receive comments from the instructor and from your peer reviewer via email. You will then use these comments to revise your paper. Your final paper must include a cover letter that details the changes you made to your draft based on feedback from the instructor as well as from your peer reviewer. Additionally, students are encouraged to meet with the TA during the week of November 27 to review their feedback and discuss plans for revision. By the deadline, you will submit the literature review. The literature review should include the manuscript itself as well as a cover letter describing the changes made in response to comments from the instructor and the peer reviewer."

We know that it can be anxiety-provoking to recognize that you need help and to ask for it. And we also know that getting the help we need can make a big difference, both inside and outside the classroom. So, we encourage you to reach out quickly for the help and support that you need!\n\n\n2 I need help with my mental or physical health…\n\nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, either call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988, or call 911.\nUniversity Counseling Service: https://counseling.uiowa.edu, or 319-335-7294\nStudent Health: https://studentlife.uiowa.edu/departments/student-health, or 319-335-8394\nStudent Wellness: https://studentwellness.uiowa.edu, or 319-335-8394\n\n\n\n3 I need help with academic accommodations…\n\nStudent Disability Services (SDS; https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu) is available to help determine what academic accommodations may be available to you (e.g., notes, extra time for exams, scheduling accommodations, etc.).\nYou can apply for student accommodations here: https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/accommodations/apply (call 319-335-1462 or email sds-info@uiowa.edu if questions!).\nWe are happy to provide recommended accommodations as a part of this course, but we need a letter from SDS requesting them.\n\n\n\n4 I’m struggling and thinking about withdrawing…\n\nThe Academic Support and Retention (ASR; https://asr.uiowa.edu) office can work with you and your instructors to generate a retention plan to support your academic success and help you get back on track.\nThe ASR office can be reached at uc-retention@uiowa.edu or (319) 335-1497.\n\n\n\n5 I need help with a crisis or emergency situation…\n\nStudent Care & Assistance (https://dos.uiowa.edu/assistance; 319-335-1162) provides assistance to students experiencing crisis and emergency situations. These situations may include hospitalization, medical emergencies or long-term illness, mental health concerns, chronic conditions, death of a family member, natural disasters, off-campus living concerns, and unexpected events or challenges.\n\n\n\n6 I need help with this class…\nPlease come to Office Hours with one of the TAs or with Professor Petersen. If you can’t attend office hours, please email any of us to arrange a time to meet and discuss how best to help you move forward in the class. We are all eager to talk with you and help you to succeed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "text": "1.2 Current Study\nTo accomplish our mission, we are are currently conducting the School Readiness Study. The School Readiness Study is a longitudinal study that follows children from 3–7 years of age to better understand how self-regulation and externalizing problems develop, from a bio-psycho-social perspective. In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and how neural development influences the development of children’s self-regulation and externalizing problems. EEG is a method of measuring meaningful differences in children’s self-regulation through ERPs—EEG activity that occurs in response to stimuli—which may be a powerful way of reliably detecting patterns of brain activity that predict behavioral outcomes."
